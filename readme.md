# ExifViewer

This is a simple tool to view exif data (specifically GPS coordinates) of 
a picture. This is an open source project that aims to demonstrate the use
of `wxPython` for a GUI project.

## How To Use

This is a very early version and not much feature is yet written on it. To 
use this, download the release file. Then on the executable, place an image
with a filename `image.jpg`. In this version, the exact filename should be 
followed in order to work.

(At the time of writing, there's no release yet.)
